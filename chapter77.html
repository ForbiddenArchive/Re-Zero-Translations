<p>Re Zero Arc 6 Chapter 77 - Signal for the Counterattack

With his thoughts burning hot and running with as much strength as he could pump into these legs, he finally reached that place. In that extremely cold world where the air was so crisp and cold standing in stark contrast to his heart pumping the hot blood in my chest, he found the back he have wanted to see.

"..."

His heart nearly exploded the moment her thin, supple back jumped into the view.He can barely hold back the overflowing love blooming in his chest.

This is not the time to let his heart blow up and die from cuteness.

Biting back down on his teeth hard, he looked over the fiercely fighting back to look at the face of their enemy. 

He has long, dark brown hair and a crude outfit wrapped in rags. And more striking was the evil glare in his eyes that trampled the lives of others and literally devoured them ---

"Ley Batenkaitos!"

Barking with as loud voice as you can, assert your presence and pull the enemy's attention to you.

Even if only for a moment, if you could divert the enemy's attention it's a profit. Of course, it's possible that attacks may flew to me for that moment, but as long as it reduces harm towards her it's fine in my books.

With love that's filling me right now, I feel like I can even fly on the sky.

"As long as it can improve the odds, even if only a little"

Standing on this side of the frozen floor, gathering my strength in my stomach I started watching Ley. With my entire attention on his movements, whatever moment he makes---

"Aa..."

Subaru's preparedness is shattered with a single look from the amethyst eyes that looked back at him.

"....."

Black eyes and the purple eyes met in a gaze.At that moment, Subaru felt like he was going to be swept away by the wave of emotions rising in those purple eyes.Those eyes always binds and drowns his heart.

It's because those makes you want to gather all those feelings that reside in it.

So...

"Wait, It's dangerous! Well, you may not know, uhm, know about me, but that there is our enemy! Leave him to me! Even if you don't know me!"

He blinked at her waving her arms around flustered and cautioning us to be on guard.A beat later, the meaning of those words sank in. ---There are indeed memories of being said the same words inside him. At the same time he understood what's happening.

And he is really glad; that he is the first one to arrive here.

He knows what to say, what to call out at this moment. And knowing that, the words he meant to say in the first place, came out calling,

"---It's fine, Emilia-tan"

Sorry for causing you troubles, making you worry over me and making you wait.

Holding those thoughts in his mind, he nodded at her while relaxing his lips in an out-of-place manner. And, with understanding dawning in her eyes at those words, he continued looking at the silver-haired girl.

Right hand pointed to heavens, the other on his waist, he stuck a pose. He didn't have to do it, but if he did that his resolve will be decided. For that---

"---My name is Natsuki Subaru. I am Emilia-tan's number one knight!"

"Subaru--!!"

"What!?"

Right after saying "It's decided", the silver-haired girl----Emilia plunged into subaru with a happy face.

Nearly flying away from that force, Subaru somehow managed to bear her weight by leaning back heavily. No need to worry, she is light like the angel's wings. No problem at all.

If there's any problem----

"Eh, Emilia-tan!? It's sudden and unexpected so I am surprised and you are super soft and smells nice! Did you change your shampoo!?"

"Subaru's and idiot! A biiig idiot! Made me worry soo, soo much! And yet just like that.... idiot! idiot, idiot!?"

"I have been called a biiig idiot! Well, it's not like I have any excuse..."

Subaru is overwhelmed by the accusations coming from the big eyes of the person his hands. In the meantime subaru's mind and vocabulary is in turmoil at the how close they are.

Anyhow, Subaru took hold of Emilia's slender shoulders and made her part reluctantly.

"Sorry for making you worry. But I am back. ---Resurrected? Glued back together? Basically I am like a completed Natsuki Subaru, anyway, I am fine"

"Aa...."

"A complete Natsuki Subaru is a thing of past. ---It's Natsuki Subaru's explosive debut"

Trying to make Emilia unworried, Subaru prattled on with full force. While Subaru is immersed in these thoughts,  Emilia blinked and touched his chest.

At that ticklish, gentle sensation, Subaru's body couldn't help but tremble.

"Well, did you get properly back together?"

"-----"

"Subaru without his memories is the same Subaru. So, even if Subaru remembers everything now, uhmm, even if for a short time, the Subaru who did his best....."

"Aaa, yes. Everything's all right"

Emilia affirms Subaru's footsteps with difficult to say words, while touching his chest.
