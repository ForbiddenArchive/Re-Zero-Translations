<p>With my thoughts burning hot and running with as much strength as I could pump into these legs, I finally reached that place.

"As long as it can improve the odds, even if only a little"
Standing on this side of the frozen floor, gathering my strength in my stomach I started watchinf Ley. With my entire attention on his movements, whatever moment he makes---
